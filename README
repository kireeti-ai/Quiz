### Setup & Run

This project is in two parts: the `backend` (Spring Boot API) and the `Frontend` (React App). You must run **both** at the same time.

#### 1. Backend (Spring Boot)

First, get the backend server running.

1.  **Navigate to the backend:**
    ```bash
    # From the root project folder
    cd backend
    ```

2.  **Configure the database:**
    -   Edit `src/main/resources/application.properties` to set your PostgreSQL database URL, username, and password.

3.  **Build the project:**
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

4.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```
    -   The backend will now be running on `http://localhost:8081`.

#### 2. Frontend (React)

In a **new and separate terminal**, get the frontend UI running.

1.  **Navigate to the frontend:**
    ```bash
    # From the root project folder
    cd Frontend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    -   The frontend development server will start, and it should automatically open `http://localhost:5173` (or a similar port) in your browser.

---

## Access the App

Once both the backend and frontend are running, you can access the application by visiting:
**`http://localhost:5173`** (or whichever port your frontend is running on)

## API Endpoints

The backend API runs on `http://localhost:8081`.
